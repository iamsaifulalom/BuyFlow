## 1️⃣ Clear Scope (MVP Only)

✅ Auth (signup/login, JWT or localStorage)  
✅ Products & Categories (CRUD for admin, view for customer)  
✅ Cart (frontend or backend MVP)  
✅ Orders (place order, view orders)  
✅ Admin dashboard (update order status)  
✅ Basic styling (functional, readable, TailwindCSS)

❌ Payments (Stripe/PayPal)  
❌ AI chat  
❌ Email verification  
❌ Advanced search/filters  
❌ Animations or fancy UI

**Rule:** Only MVP features now. Extra features = later.

## 2️⃣ Technology Stack & Tools

### Backend
- Node.js + Express.js (JavaScript)  
- Mongoose + MongoDB  
- JWT auth  
- Postman or Insomnia (API testing)

### Frontend
- Next.js + TypeScript  
- TailwindCSS for styling  
- Axios or Fetch for API calls  
- React Context / Zustand for global state

### Development Tools
- Git + GitHub  
- VSCode (or any editor)  
- Node Version Manager (nvm)  
- Postman / Insomnia  
- Browser dev tools

## 3️⃣ Project Structure

- **Monorepo**: `frontend/` + `backend/` + `Mongoose/`  
- Feature-based structure for both backend and frontend  
- Keep reusable utilities centralized  
- Separate modules for auth, products, orders, cart, admin

---

## 4️⃣ Development Plan

1. **Backend first**: Auth → Products → Orders → Admin  
2. Test APIs with Postman  
3. **Frontend second**: Connect pages one feature at a time  
4. Vertical slice approach: backend + frontend feature complete before moving on  
5. Daily goals: 1–2 small tasks/day (e.g., login API, product list page)  
6. Deploy MVP as soon as basic features work (Render, Railway, Vercel)

---

## 5️⃣ Time Management

- Auth & basic backend: 2–3 days  
- Products, orders, cart: 1–2 weeks  
- Frontend pages: 1–2 weeks  
- Admin dashboard: 3–5 days  
- Total MVP: ~3–4 weeks  
- Polished features (payments, cookies, email, AI): +1–2 weeks later

---

## 6️⃣ Mindset & Discipline

- **Finish > Perfect**: MVP must be deployable  
- No constant redesigns  
- Stick to scope  
- Track progress visually (Trello / Notion / GitHub Projects)  
- Skip anything blocking > 30 min, mark TODO, continue  
- Deploy early, fix bugs later

---

## ✅ Summary: Enough to Finish

1. **MVP scope** strictly  
2. **Monorepo + modular folder structure**  
3. **Backend ready first**, fully tested  
4. **Frontend connected per feature**  
5. **Daily small goals & progress tracking**  
6. **Deploy MVP early**  
7. **Ignore extras until MVP done**
